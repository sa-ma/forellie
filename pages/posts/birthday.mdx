I’m usually shit at writing how I feel except when it’s inspired by pain, but like everything with you, it feels different. So here I am watching you sleep while Masego croons the jazzy Tadow off the playlist I created for you, and nothing else captures perfectly how I feel in the moment. I remember the first day you asked me what I wanted from you, and my response at that time didn’t even make any sense to me, but it was honest. 

I’ve had to fight and toll hard for everything good that has come to me just to lose it, and just when I lost all hope and resigned myself to my lonely fate, the stars aligned and sent you my way. Words can never be enough to describe how perfect you are to me. I stare at you randomly and then give you a forehead kiss to ensure this isn’t a dream and I’m not lost in a world created by Christopher Nolan.

Content isn’t something I’m familiar with, as my entire being is always in a constant neverending motion. When things are moving faster than I can keep up, I think about you, and the universe comes to a halt. Whatever problems I have are inconsequential around you because, for once, I feel like I have a north star, and as long as I keep looking to her, I’ll never be lost.

I believe I exist to make you happy, and you have no idea how much I’m dedicating to the cause. The day Mr and Mrs Julius decided to bless the world with your presence will forever be special to me. My Khalessi, the breaker of chains, you are loved, and I’ll spend every waking moment showing that to you.

In the spirit of one-upping, I’m creating this space to showcase my love for you. This is the original metaverse. Any other one is a counterfeit. I hope it lasts forever. The plan is for it to be filled with so much love that’ll give you joy. 


With love
